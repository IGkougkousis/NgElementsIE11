# Angular Elements IE11

A template project to create independent angular elements that work in IE11.

This was inspired by this series of blog posts:

Please read them, they are very good. Parts 1,2,5 are the most relevant. I don't use anything from 3, 4 at all. But still read them.

Obviously `git clone`, `npm install` before doing anything else.

## Create new elements

1. Use CLI to generate a new application: `ng generate application my-app`

2. In `angular.json` find the part that refers to `my-app` and change `outputHashing` to `"none"` and `extractCss` to `false`. Add `"node_modules/@webcomponents/custom-elements/src/native-shim.js"` to the `scripts` array (should be empty by default)

3. In `projects/my-app/src/app/polyfills.ts` you must include:
   - `import 'classlist.js'` (this exists in the template generated by the CLI, uncomment it)
   - `import '@webcomponents/custom-elements/custom-elements.min'`

4. In `project/my-app/src/browserslist` delete the `not` before `IE9-IE11`

5. Assuming you only have an `AppComponent`, make sure your `app.module.ts` looks something like this:

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule, Injector, CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
import { createCustomElement } from '@angular/elements';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
  entryComponents: [AppComponent],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(private injector: Injector) {}
  ngDoBootstrap() {
    const appCE = createCustomElement(AppComponent, {
      injector: this.injector,
    });
    customElements.define('my-app', appCE);
  }
}
```

Write your code and build. It should now work in IE11.

`npm run build:my-app` <-- you need to write this in the style of `build:demo`. Same for `dev:demo`

## Test your element

I created a dev server for testing purposes. The point of Angular Elements is that they don't need to part of an existing Angular application in order to work. They are independent.

`devserver.js` is a simple express app that server `devindex.html` and the element code that resides in `/compiled-elements`. 

The npm scripts `build:demo` and `dev:demo` show how to build and run dev environment for the `demo-element`. Follow the same procedure. Create your own and run them. Pass the element name as a parameter to `concat-scripts.js` and `devserver.js` and it should work.

You will only need to **manually** change `devindex.html`. I couldn't find a way to make that generic, if you have any ideas, pull requests are welcome.
